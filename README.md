# mmu-Java-simulator
Memory Management Unit - JAVA project.
This project implements a system to manage a memory unit. The task of the memory unit, is to identify if a requested page is not in the RAM. In case the page does not exist in RAM, the MMU will retrieve it from the hard drive.

Simulate RAM (client), Hard disk(server) and MMU work when page-fault or page-replacement accure

When you first initialize the unit, you choose a replacement algorithm for the MMU (implemented with Java-Generics).

This project uses Client-Server, OOP (Java), Multi-threading, GUI (Swing).
